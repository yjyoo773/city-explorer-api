**Author**: Ellis Yoo
**Version**: 1.0.2

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Create a server for City Explorer App to call data and send it to the front-end side.
## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Libraries that are needed are cors, express, and dotenv
## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
By importing `weather.json` we get the data needed. Then, creating a `Forecast` constructor take data we want from `weather.json` we set it as properties and send those data back to the front end.
